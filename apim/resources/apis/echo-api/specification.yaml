      summary: Retrieve resource
      description: A demonstration of a GET call on a sample resource. It is handled by an "echo" backend which returns a response equal to the request (the supplied headers and body are being returned as received).
      operationId: retrieve-resource
      parameters:
        - name: param1
          in: query
          description: A sample parameter that is required and has a default value of "sample".
          required: true

            enum:
              - sample

      responses:
        '200':
          description: Returned in all cases.
    put:
      summary: Modify Resource
      description: A demonstration of a PUT call handled by the same "echo" backend as above. You can now specify a request body in addition to headers and it will be returned as well.
      operationId: modify-resource
      responses:
        '200':
          description: ''
    post:
      summary: Create resource
      description: A demonstration of a POST call based on the echo backend above. The request body is expected to contain JSON-formatted data (see example below). A policy is used to automatically transform any request sent in JSON directly to XML. In a real-world scenario this could be used to enable modern clients to speak to a legacy backend.
      operationId: create-resource
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            example:
              vehicleType: train
              maxSpeed: 125
              avgSpeed: 90

      responses:

          description: ''
    delete:
      summary: Remove resource
      description: A demonstration of a DELETE call which traditionally deletes the resource. It is based on the same "echo" backend as in all other operations so nothing is actually deleted.
      operationId: remove-resource
      responses:
        '200':
          description: ''
    head:
      summary: Retrieve header only
      description: The HEAD operation returns only headers. In this demonstration a policy is used to set additional headers when the response is returned and to enable JSONP.
      operationId: retrieve-header-only
      responses:
        '200':
          description: ''
  /resource-cached:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve resource (cached)
      description: A demonstration of a GET call with caching enabled on the same "echo" backend as above. Cache TTL is set to 1 hour. When you make the first request the headers you supplied will be cached. Subsequent calls will return the same headers as the first time even if you change them in your request.
      operationId: retrieve-resource-cached
